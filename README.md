# üöë Ambulance Dispatch and Tracking System

The **Ambulance Dispatch and Tracking System** is a Flutter-based project designed to simplify the process of requesting and tracking ambulances in Bloemfontein. The system consists of two main components:

1. **Mobile Application**: Allows users to request ambulances, track them in real-time, and manage their profiles.
2. **Admin Dashboard**: A Flutter Web-based interface for managing ambulances, verifying accounts, and assigning requests. For the admin dashboard and web functionalities, please refer to the Repository [Ambulance_Dispatch_Application_Admin](https://github.com/SbudahNkoane/Ambulance_Dispatch_Application_Admin.git).

This project leverages **Flutter** for both the mobile and web platforms, with **Firebase** as the backend for authentication, database, and real-time tracking. Additionally, it uses the **Google Maps API** for ambulance location tracking and real-time map integration.

## üìñ How It Works
1. **Request Ambulances**: Users log in and request an ambulance.
2. **Track Status**: View real-time updates and status of ambulance requests.
3. **Location Tracking**: Track ambulance locations on Google Maps.
